This is just an integrated dependency on my projects promotion for my own use.

The promotion content can be found [here](https://github.com/fankes/fankes/blob/main/project-promote), open and transparent.

Project dependencies are published to my [maven-repository](https://github.com/fankes/maven-repository).

这仅仅是关于我的项目推广的一个集成化依赖，方便我自己使用，推广的内容在 [这里](https://github.com/fankes/fankes/blob/main/project-promote) 可以找到，公开透明。

项目依赖已发布到我的 [maven-repository](https://github.com/fankes/maven-repository)。
